 Visualization-Python
 
An analysis of student performance data using Python, Seaborn, and Pandas.
Description of the dataset:
This dataset contains information about secondary school students from two Portuguese schools. It was collected to study the factors that influence academic success in mathematics. The data includes student grades, demographic details, social habits, and family background information, making it useful for predicting student performance.

## Key Insights from Visualizations


### Academic Factors
* **Past Performance is a Strong Predictor**: There is a very strong negative relationship between the number of past class failures and final grades. Students with zero failures achieve a full range of grades, while those with even one or two failures rarely achieve high scores.
* **Study Time Matters**: A clear positive trend exists between weekly study time and academic performance. The median grade consistently increases with more hours spent studying, with students studying over 10 hours a week performing the best on average.
* **Attendance is Crucial**: Increased school absences are linked to lower final grades. While not a perfect correlation, the highest-achieving students almost always have very few absences.

### Social & Lifestyle Factors
* **Social Life Has an Impact**: Students who go out with friends very frequently (4-5 on the scale) tend to have lower median grades than those with a more moderate social life.
* **Alcohol Consumption Correlates with Lower Grades**: Higher weekend alcohol consumption is strongly associated with poorer academic performance. The highest grades are almost exclusively achieved by students who report very low alcohol intake.
* **Romantic Relationships May Influence Grades**: Students not in a romantic relationship have a slightly higher median grade and a greater concentration of high scores compared to those who are.
* **Internet Access is Nearly Universal**: The vast majority of students (over 83%) have internet access at home, indicating it's a standard resource for this student population.

### Family & Home Environment
* **Parental Background Shows Minor Influence**: Factors like parents' cohabitation status show a statistically small impact on student grades. While students with parents living together have a slightly higher average, the difference is minimal.
* **Family Support is Modestly Helpful**: While the median grade is slightly higher for students who receive educational support from their family, the overall impact doesn't appear to be a major differentiating factor in performance.
